# Fuzzy_Fire_Detection
My end of year project_ Not done yet !

## Preview

The goal of this project is to create an IoT node that's meant to be part of a mesh network of other similar nodes, in order to create a real-time fire propagation tracking system that would help firefighters and land owners to be safe, be effecient in fighting the fire, and be fast to act.

The implemented fuzzy system is studied and designed in (this paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.06.008)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.06.008] , I just understood the system and implemented it! **I claim no ownership over the actual design of the system, neither do I guarantee the effictiveness of my implemented solution**.

This code is meant to be embedded into an IoT node, that's supposed to end up being a **fire detection & alarming system, powered with energy harvesting techniques**. 

This code isn't final, and will be edited over the next period, changes are to be expected.
